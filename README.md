# JavaScript-Udemy
This project is the journey of learning the Git and GitHub while learning JavaScript alongside in Udemy. The project contain the my journey and the commands been used while I was learning and addvancing ahead.

This is the first JavaScript code which I will be using. Taking help of these file I am also using a try and error to learn GIT command using terminal window.

Date : 2nd Oct 2019 : I have used my first git commands and did practically in my terminal window. I have added two file index.html and its supporting file Jss.js to a repository. These file were made while I am learning JavaScript language. While using the command line I have first decided where to add a git clone url to a location, then I have use git clone <url> command to make a git file in my local repository. Then I have moved my these two files from their previous location to the Git folder location using command line commads instead of normal GUI copy paste. I have learned few more commands of the terminal which I didn't know. I learned how to add a parenthesis while getting into a directory in terminal. After these, I used git add command to add the files, then I use the git status command to confirm their status. Then I have used the command git commit -m " <message>" and commited it. Finally I have used the git push command, enter my configured User Id and Password to WOLLA! my first hands-on experience of adding a file using git command.
